    <h1>FeedbackHelper</h1>
    <p>
      FeedbackHelper is a tool for efficiently creating bullet-pointed feedback
      on student assignments. It exploits the fact that certain phrases are
      likely to be repeated many times when marking one assignment for a large
      class of students, automatically recognising frequently used phrases and
      making it easy to import them for new students.
    </p>
    <p>
      The tool was developed at the University of St Andrews, and exports
      feedback and grade files suitable for bulk upload to
      <a href="https://mms.st-andrews.ac.uk/mms/">MMS</a>.
    </p>

    <h2>Installation</h2>
